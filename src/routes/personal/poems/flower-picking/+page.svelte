<Content title="flower picking">

        i love the moments when you pick the flowers for me,
        you're so comfortable telling me why you picked your flowers,
        you were willing to make time with me picking flowers together,
        I really enjoyed it, though you put more effort into it however.

        you and I, watched the stars gaze,
        sometimes I wish, we could do for days,
        I imagine, how cute and sweet—having someone like you,
        I never knew my flowers for you, were already blooming and grown.

        more than ever, I wanted to pick flowers,
        I pushed myself too hard, searching for hours just to find one,
        even then, you'd sometimes still make time,
        only then did I realize my mistakes, as I slowly began to wither.

        I started losing hope, thinking I could never keep up,
        picking up flowers, was never something I was good at,
        for you, I was never your cup of tea,
        nor the flowers i hope you quietly grew for me,
        so I stood quiet, quietly hoping, you never see the flowers I kept behind me.
